Welcome to the GitHub Advanced Security Organisation! :wave:

This organisation contains open source initiatives created by developers at GitHub (and around the world) to show the art of the possible with advanced security. :octocat: :computer:

[GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) consists of [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/), [Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning), [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning), [Security Overview](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-overview/about-the-security-overview) and [Dependency Review](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review). A core principle of each of these solutions is being automated and integrable via API's and Webhooks. In this organisation, you will find starter kits, actions, custom queries and bundles, scripts and full-blown solutions that show off how you can integrate into GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS). 

In comparison to the official GitHub organisation, a lot of the software you find here is developed as a best effort. These are open-source solutions developed outside of core responsibilities but with the aim for you to leverage and consume as you would any standard open-source software. :open_hands: 

We love contributions and feedback from you! So please feel free to open pull requests and issues as you can! :two_hearts:

Welcome and we hope what you find here useful :bow:
